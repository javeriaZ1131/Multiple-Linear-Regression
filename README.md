# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Implement multiple linear regression using Ordinary Least Square method from built in Python Function.
and also write 
predict().
r2_score()
method for the evaluation of my model.

Step 1: Firstly we will load the dataset from csv file.
Step 2:
Before performing the model the  normalization is peformed on datasets.
Step 3:
Null values Handling on the dataset beofre performing the prediction.

Step 4 Splitting of the training data into train and test var. Where test data will be the on on which predictions will be performed.
Step 5:
 Apply the Multiple linear regiression on it and perform fitness.
Step 6:
 Now perform the pridictions on the testing daata.
Step 7:
Now calculate the r2_score()  of the testing data w r t predictions calculated.
